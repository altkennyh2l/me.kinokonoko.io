      "detailExplanation": "A basic rhythm game created using Unity, this project served as a practice exercise to become acquainted with CRIWARE, particularly ADX. All audio elements in the project are managed through CRIWARE ADX, including the lane highlight callback during the chorus and vocal cutoff when a note is missed. The changes that occur during the chorus are facilitated by the cue callback feature in ADX, where I provide an on/off switch for the change and activate the switch when the playback passes through the callback marker. Vocal cutoff is also achieved using ADX, where the separate vocal track is muted when a note is missed.",

Additionally, the application employs the VOICEVOX engine to generate TTS responses for users. To enhance the avatar's visual appeal, facial lip syncing animation is implemented using uLipSync. However, due to the nature of TTS, lipsyncing is not as natural as regular human vocal. Improving lipsync accuracy is a goal for future updates and further development of InterBolt. *Note: Please be aware that the VOICEVOX Engine used in this demo video is hosted on a personal server with low specifications specifically for AI-related tasks. As a result, the TTS response time may be relatively longer compared to optimized server setups.",
